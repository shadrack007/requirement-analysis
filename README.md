# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This repository is dedicated to exploring the critical phase of **Requirement Analysis** in the software development lifecycle33.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
- Requirement Gathering
  - Engage with stakeholders to collect initial requirements.
  - Use various techniques like interviews, surveys, and workshops
- Requirement Elicitation
  - Refine and elaborate on the gathered requirements.
  - Use techniques like brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping.
- Requirement Documentation
  - Document the requirements in a detailed and structured format.
  - Use requirement specification documents, user stories, and use cases.
- Requirement Analysis and Modeling
  - Analyze and prioritize the requirements.
  - Create models to visualize and understand the requirements.
- Requirement Validation
  - Review and validate the requirements with stakeholders.
  - Define acceptance criteria and ensure traceability.

### Types of Requirements
- Functional Requirements: Describe what the system should do, examples include User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.
- Non-functional Requirements: Describe how the system should perform, example Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.

### Importance in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
- Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
- Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
